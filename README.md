# Speech_to_srt
This is a project, made by me and my friend Pavel, which grabs an audio or a video file and returns a transcription and .srt file.
We are using Google's speech recognition API.

11-02-2016 - For now, only the transcription part works
9-04-2016 - Made the transcription work for a whole audio or a video file, some things have to be fixed, but I will work on them tomorrow
